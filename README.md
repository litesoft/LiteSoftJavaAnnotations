# LiteSoftJavaAnnotations

A set of Java Annotations primarily used for documenting contractual obligations and expectations

On maven Central ([latest release](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.litesoft/annotations/2.2.0)):
```html
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.litesoft</groupId>
    <artifactId>annotations</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.0</version>
  </dependency>
```

Some of the annotations also include behavior (mostly around data validation and normalization).

The Annotations with Behavior(s) are:
- NotEmpty
- NotEmptyAndContainsNoNulls
- NotNegative
- NotNull
- NotNullAndContainsNoNulls
- Positive
- Required (similar to NotNull but with different error text)
